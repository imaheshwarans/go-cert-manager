# go-cert-manager

## 1. Overview
The **go-cert-manager** is a microservice designed to handle certificate management. It provides CRUD operations for certificates, ensuring secure storage and retrieval. The service is built using Go, Mux for routing, and PostgreSQL for persistence. The system ensures that certificates are properly issued, stored, retrieved, and revoked securely.

## 2. Architecture
### 2.1 Components
- **API Layer:** Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers.
- **Service Layer:** Implements business logic for certificate management.
- **Database Layer:** Manages data persistence using PostgreSQL.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based authentication with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Uses Prometheus and Grafana for observability and debugging.
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker for packaging and Kubernetes for deployment.

### 2.2 High-Level Flow
1. Client sends an API request (e.g., creating a certificate).
2. The API layer validates the request and forwards it to the service layer.
3. The service layer interacts with the database layer to perform operations.
4. The response is returned to the client.

## 3. API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint          | Description                 |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| POST   | /certificates    | Create a new certificate    |
| GET    | /certificates    | Get all certificates        |
| GET    | /certificates/{id} | Get a certificate by ID    |
| PUT    | /certificates/{id} | Update a certificate       |
| DELETE | /certificates/{id} | Delete a certificate       |

### 3.1 Request & Response Examples
#### Create Certificate
**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "example.com",
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "example.com",
  "issued_at": "2025-03-22T14:30:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

#### Get Certificate by ID
**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "example.com",
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "issued_at": "2025-03-22T14:30:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## 4. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE certificates (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    certificate TEXT NOT NULL,
    private_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    issued_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```
### 4.1 Indexing & Performance Optimization
- Indexing on `id` for fast lookups.
- Index on `expires_at` for efficient expiration checks.
- Using UUIDs for globally unique identification.

## 5. Security Considerations
- **Encryption:** Store certificates securely using AES-256 encryption.
- **Access Control:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with different roles (admin, user, auditor).
- **Authentication:** Secure API using JWT tokens.
- **Logging:** Log API access but avoid storing sensitive information in logs.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse by implementing request throttling.

## 6. Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Go
- **Framework:** Mux for HTTP routing
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT for authentication
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

## 7. Deployment Strategy
1. **Local Development:** Run using Docker Compose with PostgreSQL.
2. **Staging:** Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster with automated testing.
3. **Production:** Use CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or ArgoCD) for seamless deployments.
4. **Secrets Management:** Use HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive information.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- **ACME Protocol Support:** Automate certificate issuance with Let's Encrypt.
- **API Rate Limiting:** Implement per-user and per-IP rate limits.
- **Certificate Expiration Alerts:** Notify users before certificate expiration.
- **Multi-Tenant Support:** Isolate certificates per user or organization.
- **REST & gRPC Support:** Provide both REST and gRPC APIs for better interoperability.
- **Revocation Handling:** Implement a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) mechanism.
